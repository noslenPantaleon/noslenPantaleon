<h1> Hi there 👋<h1/>
</div>

### I’m a Junior developer with experience in full-stack development, building frontend websites with Reactjs, and backend Apis with Python, also I like to research and experiment with new technologies like the Internet Of Things, and computer visions for interactive arts and science research.  

All my life I was Working as a filmmaker, vj/video mapping, animations and postproduction, but because I was working on a computer, I started to use and experiment with coding tools like javascript and python to make animations more efficient for my work.

 I started my software development career in 2018, learning about Arduino and processing as a hobbyist, and 3 years later, I realize that I really like to code and think logically and creatively at the same time, and I decided to start my development roadmap by learning python, and I made some basic, and intermediate courses in the field of backend and computer visions, and 2 years ago I decide to learn and experiment with frontend technologies because I like the idea to make interfaces and interactive experience for apps too.
